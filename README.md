## How to install:

Simply run 

```
npm i && npm start
```

The project was built as an example on how to fetch data from an API and it made me realise I'm not a designer. 

I've succeded in writing tests for actions and reducers, however the component unit tests have caused me some grief.

I've played around with styled-components, useState, useReducer.

I've implemented a feature-based structure, and also aimed to keep the code as clean as possible. 

I've refactored the code into separate files based on logic and responsabilities. 

Also, I used a little pathing trick, to make the imports easier to read.

I've customized the default look, feel and details that create-react-app started with to better match the project.
